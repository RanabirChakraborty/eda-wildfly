# eda-wildfly

A demo lab showcasing how to use Event-Driven Ansible (EDA) to implement automated remediation strategies for WildFly.
This project leverages the Ansible Middleware WildFly collection to establish a seamless connection and trigger corrective actions in response to events.

## 🚀 What this project demonstrates

* Using EDA rulebooks to monitor and respond to WildFly events

* Implementing self-healing remediation strategies for application servers

* Integrating Ansible Middleware WildFly connection for management and automation

## 🛠️ Use cases

* Restarting or recovering WildFly services when issues are detected

* Applying dynamic configurations based on event triggers

* Automating day-2 operations in a resilient and event-driven way

## 📂 Repository structure

* `rulebooks/` → Event-Driven Ansible rulebooks

* `playbooks/` → Supporting playbooks for remediation

* `inventory/` → Inventory details for WildFly instances
